# Virtual Coiling using Pre-shape Path Planning

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a fast virtual coiling algorithm called Pre-shape Path Planning (P3). The purpose of this algorithm is to aid in predicting and improving the treatment outcome of endovascular coiling for intracranial aneurysms. P3 focuses on providing both accuracy and speed in patient-specific coil deployment simulations.
